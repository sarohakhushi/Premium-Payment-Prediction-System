# Premium-Payment-Prediction-System
This project focuses on predicting whether an insurance policyholder is likely to pay their upcoming premium on time. By analyzing past payment behavior and demographic factors, the system identifies customers who may delay or miss payments, enabling insurers to take preemptive actions to improve retention and mitigate risks.
